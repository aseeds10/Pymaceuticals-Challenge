# Pymaceuticals Challenge
Challenge 5 - Matplotlib

## Description
Prompt: 
<br>I have just joined Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring formof skin cancer.
<br>
<br>As a senior data analyst at the company, I have been given access to the complete data from their most recent animalstudy. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.
<br>
<br>The executive team has tasked me with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of theclinical study. They have also asked me for a top-level summary of the study results.
